# Proyection React Frontend

## About
---
This is the react frontend project

## Run the application
---
First, get the latest version of the proyection spring backend.

## Branching
---
- `feature/[FEATURE_NAME]`

  Every new feature that would be implemented should have its own branch
  
  For example: `feature/crudUsers`

- `fix/[BUG_REPORTED]`

  If we reported bugs in `develop`, create a specific branch to fix it.
  
  For example: `fix/createTask`

After the work in your branch is finished, PR to `develop` branch.
#### :warning: ALERT : Do not attempt to push to `master` branch under any circumstances. This can severly end up in having a deliverable faulty product or waste precious time of our lives. Seek for guidance :godmode: if unsure.

#### Team todo's:

- Implement basic user interface for crud operations.
- Make the Mockups for the user interface.
